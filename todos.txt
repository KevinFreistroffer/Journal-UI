consider using shadcn for all components

use the data transfer layer. use canShowUsername or isAuthenticated or something with roles, hasUserRoleAccess

save new categories in the DB.

unify all styles, such as button hover where it goes from color > darker color, or vice versa.

dashboardcontainer should set the same styles across all pages

add a save summary button / feature.

consider the https://www.anthropic.com/ home styles

redo the form action error messages

create a logging system saving errors to a file. example: signup action returns { ..., adminMessage: "No body.data returned from the server".}
- save this text, with timestamp, with user info username, email, etc.

save journal modal multiselect figure out how to style it or use diff lib.

dark theme black is too dark. use githubs black. rgb(21,27,35)

use colors in globals.css
water ripple background animated

enable mfa

replace session.userId with session._id

the /api/update api route, shouldn't require a userId, since it can get it from a server function?

replace the keyword freq select with another component. too slow.

quill how to use css modules?

By default at least 1 category must exist. If the user edits "My Journals" to "" or tries to delete it if its the only category, than a message that

-- Should make it so categories aren't required. You can delete all categories. Hide any category dropdowns/features.

public private journals

make sure card in dashboard title, content etc. is aligned on the same row

need to test API requests when there's no user_id. (user shouldnt ever be not available to able to send requests, however...)

dynamic rendering? dashboard cards, if storage not fetched yet, don't render?

replace the dropdowns that remove the scrolling functionality, such as the header avatar menu hides the scroll bar shifting the screen

when creating an journal, determine if the create category form is needed, or instead show an input, and when the journal is saved
it'll try to create the category. seems like a better idea.

consider adding a thing to every feature, that says "This website is in beta. If this feature does not work, Contact Me".

Make Sidebar.Title and Sidebar.Content components.
